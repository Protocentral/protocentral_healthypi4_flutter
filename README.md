# How to use this code

This code is based on the amazingly simple-to-use Flutter cross-platform framework that can compile native code for both Android and iOS platforms with a single codebase. For more infromation on Flutter, please check [Flutter's website](https://flutter.dev/).

Here is a simple getting started guide to start using the HealthyPi v4 app code. 

1. Download and Install [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/). For more information on how to setup flutter, check out the [Installation Guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install). As of the time of writing this document, the HealthyPi v4 code uses **Flutter 1.20.1**.
2. Clone this repo to your local computer or download the code as a zip file using the "Code" > "Download ZIP" option. 
3. From inside your already setup Flutter environment, run the following commands

``` 
flutter pub get // Automatically gets all the dependency packages
flutter build apk // Builds APK file for Android platforms
flutter build ios // Build for iOS (only on mac)
```

4. It really is as simple as that.
